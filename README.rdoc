== chef-deploy

A gem that provides resources and providers for deploying ruby web apps from chef recipes


Uses the same directory layout as capistrano and steals the git remote cached deploy strategy 
from cap and adapts it to work without cap and under chef

  deploy "/data/myapp" do
    repo "git://github.com/engineyard/rack-app.git"
    branch "HEAD"
    enable_submodules true
    shallow_clone true
    action :manage
  end
